# COVID-19-Prediction
Studying the variables associated with Covid-19 and use different machine learning algorithms to classify a positive case vs. a negative case.


### Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, as a pandemic on March 11, while the exponential increase in the number of cases was risking to overwhelm health systems around the world with a demand for ICU beds far above the existing capacity, with regions of Italy being prominent examples.

Brazil recorded the first case of SARS-CoV-2 on February 26, and the virus transmission evolved from imported cases only, to local and finally community transmission very rapidly, with the federal government declaring nationwide community transmission on March 20.

Until March 27, the state of S達o Paulo had recorded 1,223 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 68 related deaths, while the county of S達o Paulo, with a population of approximately 12 million people and where Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein is located, had 477 confirmed cases and 30 associated death, as of March 23. Both the state and the county of S達o Paulo decided to establish quarantine and social distancing measures, that will be enforced at least until early April, in an effort to slow the virus spread.

One of the motivations for this challenge is the fact that in the context of an overwhelmed health system with the possible limitation to perform tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, testing every case would be impractical and tests results could be delayed even if only a target subpopulation would be tested.

### Dataset
The dataset is collected from the following link:

This dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at S達o Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital.

All data were anonymized following the best international practices and recommendations. All clinical data were standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation.

### AIM
Studying the variables associated with Covid-19 and use different machine learning algorithms to classify a positive case vs. a negative case.
